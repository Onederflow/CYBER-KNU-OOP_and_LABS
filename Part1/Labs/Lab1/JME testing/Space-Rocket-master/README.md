Space Rocket
============

Space Rocket is a simple oldschool shooting game made just for entertainment purposes. It is the first game I am creating with jMonkeyEngine.

The game is distributed under the GPL v3 for now. For more details, please read [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

From time to time executables for Win, Mac, and Linux will be released. You can download them [here](../../releases).
